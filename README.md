# reversi-minimax

This was a project for the discipline of parallel programing and it uses the minimax stragy to play the revesi game.
All positions in the board have the same weight (it was a project rule, not the best choice). 
Thre are four versions of the code: a sequential version, two versions with using the shared memory paradigm (openMP and pThreads) and one version using the message passing paradigm (openMPI)
